# Project Goals

This document outlines the high-level goals for the AI Chat Agent project.

- **Core Functionality**: Create a real-time, web-based chat interface where users can interact with an AI assistant.
- **User Experience**: The user interface should be intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing.
- **Performance**: The application should be fast and responsive, with minimal latency in message delivery and AI responses.
- **Scalability**: The backend architecture (though not detailed here) should be designed to handle a large number of concurrent users.
- **Extensibility**: The project should be easy to extend with new features and capabilities.
