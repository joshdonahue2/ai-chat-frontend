# Project Goals

This document outlines the high-level goals for the AI Chat Agent project.

- **Core Functionality**:
  - Implement a real-time, web-based chat interface for users to interact with an AI assistant.
  - Integrate with a backend AI webhook for processing and responding to user messages.
  - Include user authentication (sign-up, sign-in, sign-out) using Supabase.

- **User Experience**:
  - Design an intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing user interface with a "cyber" theme that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
  - Provide clear feedback to the user, such as loading indicators and error messages.
  - Ensure the chat history is persistent and easy to navigate.

- **Long-term Memory**:
  - Enable the AI assistant to remember previous conversations by sending conversation history with each new message.
  - Personalize the user experience by allowing the AI to access user-specific data (e.g., name) stored in their profile.

- **Performance**:
  - Optimize the application for fast loading times and responsive interactions.
  - Minimize latency in message delivery and AI responses.

- **Deployment and Maintenance**:
  - Ensure the application is easily deployable as a containerized service using Docker.
  - Maintain clear and comprehensive documentation to facilitate onboarding for new developers and AI agents.
  - Write clean, modular, and well-commented code to make the project extensible and easy to maintain.
